Subject: First Journal

It's been a rough first 2 weeks of school. Before the semester started, I thought I was set with all the classes that I had already registered for. Come to find out a few days into the semester, that I needed to move some classes around, drop some classes in order to meet my graduation plan approved by our new Professor of Military Science. I am on the road to graduate next fall and commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Utah Army National Guard. In order to accomplish this, I have to follow whatever schedule they have for me together with my core classes for my degree. Long story short, it is what it is, I will make it happen. With the missed assignments I have so far, hopefully I can complete them all (even without points) so I am not behind on all my classes. On the bright side, I am excited to learn about what this course has in store for me this semester.

Subject: Diagram

Visual aid is important in any line of work. The 2 types of diagrams we discussed in class today are "Flow diagram" and "Component diagram". Flow diagram, helps us think through how the data or processes go in our system. Component diagram, shows the structure of a system in terms of its component and how they interact. Flow diagram focuses on flow of data or control - used for process modeling, while component diagram focuses on system components and their links - used for system/module design.

SUBJECT: Legionaries Powerpoint

Powerpoint completed. I feel like I haven't done much with this group since I switched to this section from the 10am class, but I tried my best to help out in any way I can. All the contents for the slideshow were already put in, so I just cleaned up the slides and added some visual aids on there. Oh, and I've also added presentation notes for each slide.

SUBJECT: Time Management

I’ve been struggling with time management, and it’s starting to affect my grades. Part of it is that I don’t have a solid routine, and I keep underestimating how long things will take. I get distracted easily, and sometimes I avoid schoolwork because I feel overwhelmed or just mentally exhausted. On top of that, I’ve been dealing with family problems at home, which makes it even harder to focus or stay motivated. It’s like I’m constantly trying to juggle everything, and I end up dropping the ball. Still, I know I need to take steps to turn things around—even small ones like planning better, setting boundaries, and breaking tasks into smaller parts. I haven’t given up; I just need to find a way forward through all of this.
