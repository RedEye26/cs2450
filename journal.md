It's been a rough first 2 weeks of school. Before the semester started, I thought I was set with all the classes that I had already registered for. Come to find out a few days into the semester, that I needed to move some classes around, drop some classes in order to meet my graduation plan approved by our new Professor of Military Science. I am on the road to graduate next fall and commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Utah Army National Guard. In order to accomplish this, I have to follow whatever schedule they have for me together with my core classes for my degree. Long story short, it is what it is, I will make it happen. With the missed assignments I have so far, hopefully I can complete them all (even without points) so I am not behind on all my classes. On the bright side, I am excited to learn about what this course has in store for me this semester.

Subject: Diagram

Visual aid is important in any line of work. The 2 types of diagrams we discussed in class today are "Flow diagram" and "Component diagram". Flow diagram, helps us think through how the data or processes go in our system. Component diagram, shows the structure of a system in terms of its component and how they interact. Flow diagram focuses on flow of data or control - used for process modeling, while component diagram focuses on system components and their links - used for system/module design.
