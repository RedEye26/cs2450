It's been a rough first 2 weeks of school. Before the semester started, I thought I was set with all the classes that I had already registered for. Come to find out a few days into the semester, that I needed to move some classes around, drop some classes in order to meet my graduation plan approved by our new Professor of Military Science. I am on the road to graduate next fall and commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Utah Army National Guard. In order to accomplish this, I have to follow whatever schedule they have for me together with my core classes for my degree. Long story short, it is what it is, I will make it happen. With the missed assignments I have so far, hopefully I can complete them all (even without points) so I am not behind on all my classes. On the bright side, I am excited to learn about what this course has in store for me this semester.
